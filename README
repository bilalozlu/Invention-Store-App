Application url: https://bilals-invention-store.herokuapp.com

*This application is a database as a service application that includes users and their inventions.
Since it is a trial project, no password authentication required.

*I used NoSQL & MongoDB to handle data and NodeJS for back-end (handling fetch and building APIs)
and Embedded JavaScript for front-end side (rendering GUI with HTML/Javascript).

*Since I did not upload node_modules, you need to install them
by `npm install` command in order to run application in your computer.
